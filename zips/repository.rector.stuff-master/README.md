# Rector stuff

This is just a little place for my stuff, mostly in-progress releases of add-ons providing new functionality
that I may submit to the official Kodi repo at some point. The zip to install this repository in Kodi is
[repository.rector.stuff](https://github.com/rmrector/repository.rector.stuff/raw/master/latest/repository.rector.stuff-latest.zip).

Head to the support and discussion threads to tell me what you think.

## Watched status toolbox

Several tools to manage watched status and last played time. Includes context items "Mark as watched again",
"Remove one watch count", and "Clear resume status", all under "Manage...", and a service that changes the
last played time for videos to update only if at least a small portion has actually been played, hopefully
improving the usefulness of lists and add-ons using this timestamp.
